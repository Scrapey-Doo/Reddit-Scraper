# Scraper
Project Repository

## Project Description
This program will collect data from an online webpage and store it in a database. Users will be able to sign-up, login, and access their own stored data. 

Key steps
1. User needs to be able to sign in /create an account - > if the application can directly sign into reddit/twitter
2. User needs to be able to input what they want to scrape for: input a key term, key terms, time frame, POST and/or COMMENTS.
3. The application will take user information, key term, time frame and "scrape" the data.
4. Application will take each Post/comment and create an object based off of it.
5. Application will send created object to a database/server
6. GUI should display the objects stored in the database.
7. Users should be able to search/sort/delete the contents in the database
8. Users should be able to click on the post/comment (object will have a link) in the object to access the post from the source.
